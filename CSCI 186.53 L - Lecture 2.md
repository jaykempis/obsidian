### BLOCKCHAIN

##### Problem:
Payee cant verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin.
##### Solution
Timestamp server; publicly announce transactions. Participants needs to agree ona  single history of the coin. Payee has proof that at the time of each transaction, majority of the nodes agreed it was the first received.

### PROOF-OF-WORK CONCEPT
1. Majority decision is represented by the longest chain
2. Honest chain will grow and outpace competing chains if majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes
3. Proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour
